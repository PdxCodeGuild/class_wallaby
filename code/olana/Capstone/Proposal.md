# Project Overview
'Magical Beans" is an application centered on pregnancy nutrition. It is a go to app for expecting mothers looking for information on what foods are best for the baby and their own body. 


## Problem Statement
There are many sites that give information about what foods to eat and what foods not to eat, but not a one -stop shop that is comprehensive on all the potential hazards with certain foods, spices, and additives. 

The application not only a simple search on the safety of certain foods, spices, and additives, but also recipes for those that enjoy cooking, retaurant menus, and approved meal delivery services. 

## Personal Story
Say a user wants to go to popular restaurant, this website gives information on menu items that are safe and which ones are hazardous.  Who would of thought those sesame seeds flavored on those green beans in your favorite power bowl from Fresh Kitchen, could cause stimulation of the uterine muscles causing complications in your first three to four months of pregnancy. With my experience as an expectant mother, I am finding those little food items can threaten you from having a safe & healthy pregnancy. I am passionate to share this application as a tool for expectant mothers so they too can be confident about with their food choices while enjoying this exciting time in their lives. 



## Functionality
These are main parts to the applications: (1) Simple Search of food items, spices, additives for safety (2) Popular retaurant menu suggestions (3) Recipes (4) Approved meal delivery services menu items

1. There will be a home page with navigation and simple search bar for comprehensive search on food items
2. There will be a page for a list of popular restaurants and safe approved menu suggestions
3. There will be a page of recipes that are categorized. For example, recipes that ease morning sickness, recipes that help fight fatigue
4. There will be a page of approved delivery service menu items, such as dinners that are safe from Hello Fresh or Daily Harvest, etc. 

## Data Model
The application will use api(s) for most of the data stream. It will also use a database for the user profile in which the user can store favorite recipes, restaurant menus, delivery service items.

## Future 
 This application will have the marketshare similar to user that use Babylist. Babylist is an application that is a comprehensive baby shower registry. Although, in this case, Magical Bean is focus is on marketing food safety.  My hope for the growth of this product is that food companies would like to market their brand on this app as being pregnancy safe.
