1. Project Overview

Name: Cycle Tracker App (change later)

Description: An inclusive menstrual cycle tracking app for queer/trans/non-binary/gender-fluid or otherwise non-conforming folks who want to conceive, prevent pregnancy, balance hormones, or have a better understanding of their cycle. 

What problem does this app solve?

The menstrual cycle tracking apps that are currently on the market are targeted mostly to cis women and feel exlusive of non cis gendered people. But not everyone who menstruates and gives birth identifies as a woman, and certain individuals may have unique hormonal situations. Queer, trans, and NB folks have unique needs and challenges when it comes to conception and contraception that no app on the market currently addresses. 

Major features:
- Color-coded calendar or circle of dots representing each day of the cycle 
- Ability to track important events, signs, and symptoms (cycle begins, encounter with sperm, basal body temp, etc.)
- User account with personalized features (cycle length, flow length, etc.)

Libraries:
- Python/django calendar

Framesworks:
- Django

APIs:
- Moon phases


2. Functionality

Home page: menu, logo, user's specific calendar 

User profile page: username, objective (contraception, conception, hormone balancing), stats about cycle

Day view: note events, signs, symptoms
