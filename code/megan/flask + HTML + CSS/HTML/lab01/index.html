            <p>“The way to right wrongs is to turn the light of truth upon them.” ― Ida B. Wells-Barnett</p>
            <h1>Ida B. Wells</h1>
            <h3>(July 16, 1882 - March 25, 1931)</h3>
            <h2>Early 20th century black female journalist and activist</h2>
            <h3>A brief introduction to Ida B. Wells</h3>
            <p>Ida Bell Wells-Barnett, born enslaved in 1862 in Mississippi and emancipated by the Emancipation Proclamation, is arguably one of the most revolutionary and influential figures in American history.</p>
            <p>Professionally, she was an investigative journalist who not only documented lynchings in the south but also wrote about the propaganda used to justify the practice. Wells’ parents were politically active in Reconstruction Era politics and
                instilled in her the importance of education. When her parents and infant brother died during a yellow fever outbreak in her hometown, she took on the care of her other siblings and started working as a teacher. A skilled writer and persuasive
                speaker, Wells became an early founder of the NAACP and deeply involved in the early civil rights movement. She was also active and visible in the women’s movement, fighting for women's suffrage, and she was outspoken about white women’s
                refusal to acknowledge and condemn lynchings. Wells was no doubt a leader in both the civil rights and women's movements in the early 20th century, but she was also ostracized from these groups due to her articulate and unrelenting insistence
                on acknowledging the intersection between race, gender, and class.</p>
            <p>Perhaps ahead of her time, she traveled and lectured all over the world. She even owned her own newspaper! The truth was of utmost importance to her and she dedicated her entire life to exposing the hard truths about racism and sexism that
                many Americans at that time were unwilling to hear.</p>
