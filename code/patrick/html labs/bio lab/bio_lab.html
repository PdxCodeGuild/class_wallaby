            <div class="p1"> Here is an excerpt from Wikipedia:</div>
            <blockquote class="p1" cite=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Davis_(potter)>
                Davis was born in Cardiff, Wales in 1910, the only child of a Swiss mother and English father. 
                He was educated in Switzerland and England, and was fluent in German. After school he was sent to the Bournemouth School of Art where the pottery class was oversubscribed. 
                Undaunted, he worked in the pottery room after hours, turning out large numbers of enormous pots which drew the attention of the headmaster. 
                He was sent to Broadstone Potters, near Poole, which had been established in 1928 by Lancelot Cayley Shadwell and Mary Longbottom.
                Initially, he worked as a decorator, responsible for the "Joyous Pottery" range, but soon showed interest in all aspects of the craft.
                 He came under the tutelage of a certain Mr. Bean who instructed him in the skills needed at a potter's wheel.   </blockquote>
