            <p>Fine, Java MIGHT be a good example of what a programming language should be like. But Java applications are good examples of what applications SHOULDN’T be like. (pixadel) Considering the current sad state of our computer programs, software development is clearly still a black art, and cannot yet be called an engineering discipline. (Bill Clinton) Saying that Java is nice because it works on all OSes is like saying that anal sex is nice because it works on all genders. (Alanna) The best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only off by a bit. (Anonymous) Any fool can use a computer. Many do. (Ted Nelson)

              The best programmers are not marginally better than merely good ones. They are an order-of-magnitude better, measured by whatever standard: conceptual creativity, speed, ingenuity of design, or problem-solving ability. (Randall E. Stross) If the automobile had followed the same development cycle as the computer, a Rolls-Royce would today cost $100, get a million miles per gallon, and explode once a year, killing everyone inside. (Robert X. Cringely) Microsoft has a new version out, Windows XP, which according to everybody is the ‘most reliable Windows ever.’ To me, this is like saying that asparagus is ‘the most articulate vegetable ever.’ (Dave Barry) In order to understand recursion, one must first understand recursion. (Anonymous)

            <p>I don’t care if it works on your machine! We are not shipping your machine! (Vidiu Platon) There are only two industries that refer to their customers as ‘users’. (Edward Tufte) 19 Jan 2038 at 3:14:07 AM (End of the word according to Unix–2^32 seconds after January 1, 1970) They have computers, and they may have other weapons of mass destruction.

            <p>Every operating system out there is about equal… We all suck. (Microsoft senior vice president Brian Valentine describing the state of the art in OS security, 2003) There is no programming language–no matter how structured–that will prevent programmers from making bad programs. (Larry Flon) It’s not a bug – it’s an undocumented feature. (Anonymous) In C++ it’s harder to shoot yourself in the foot, but when you do, you blow off your whole leg. (Bjarne Stroustrup)</p>

            <p>Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. Friends and money - oil and water. What's the matter with you? Is this what you've become, a Hollywood finocchio who cries like a woman? "Oh, what do I do? What do I do?" What is that nonsense? Ridiculous! That's my family Kay, that's not me. Mr Corleone is Johnny Fontane's godfather. Now Italians regard that as a very close, a very sacred religious relationship.</p>

It’s on you how you want to live your life. Everyone has a choice. I pick my choice, squeaky clean. Look at the sunset, life is amazing, life is beautiful, life is what you make it. The key is to drink coconut, fresh coconut, trust me. Stay focused. The weather is amazing, walk with me through the pathway of more success. Take this journey with me, Lion!</p>

You see the hedges, how I got it shaped up? It’s important to shape up your hedges, it’s like getting a haircut, stay fresh. You see the hedges, how I got it shaped up?

            <p>It’s important to use cocoa butter. It’s the key to more success, why not live smooth? Why live rough? They key is to have every key, the key to open every door. Egg whites, turkey sausage, wheat toast, water. Of course they don’t want us to eat our breakfast, so we are going to enjoy our breakfast. They will try to close the door on you, just open it.
