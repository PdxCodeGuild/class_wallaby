# Events

An event can be something the browser does, or something a user does. Event handlers can be used to handle, verify user input, user actions, and browser actions:

- Things that should be done every time a page loads
- Things that should be done when the page is closed
- Action that should be performed when a user clicks a button
- Content that should be verified when a user inputs data
- And more ...

You can read more about events on the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events).

## Event Target

The target property of the Event interface is a reference to the object onto which the event was dispatched. The _event.target_ property can be used in order to implement event delegation.

```html
<body>
  <ul id="my-list">
    <li>rain</li>
    <li>snow</li>
    <li>sun</li>
  </ul>
  <script>
    function hide(event) {
      event.target.style.visibility = "hidden";
      console.log(event.target, event.target.tagName);
    }
    const list = document.querySelector("#my-list");
    list.addEventListener("click", hide);
  </script>
</body>
```

## Defining Events

The easiest (but worst) way to define an event is inside the attribute of a tag. You do not want to have pieces of JavaScript executing in different parts of your page, it'll quickly become overwhelmingly complicated.

```html
<button id="bt" onclick="alert('hello world!');">click</button>
```

A much better way is to assign the event listener to the element. You can read more about listeners on the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener).

```html
<button id="bt">click</button>
<script>
  const bt = document.querySelector("#bt");
  bt.addEventListener("click", function () {
    alert("hello world!");
  });
</script>
```

## The Event

An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.

The target property returns the element that triggered the event, and not necessarily the eventlistener's element.

## Event Propagation

You can see an example of event propagation on [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/bubbling-and-capturing) and [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Examples#Example_5:_Event_Propagation). This [site](https://javascript.info/bubbling-and-capturing) has a good example of event bubbling.

- `event.stopPropagation()` prevents parent elements from receiving the event
- `event.stopImmediatePropagation()` prevents other listeners from receiving the event
- `event.preventDefault()` prevents an event from triggering

## List of Events

You can find a comprehensive list of events on the [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events).

| Event        | Triggered when...                                                     |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `load`       | an element is loaded                                                  |
| `focus`      | an element gains focus                                                |
| `blur `      | element loses focus                                                   |
| `input`      | the user inputs a value                                               |
| `change`     | an input's value is changed                                           |
| `keydown`    | any key is pressed                                                    |
| `keyup`      | any key is released                                                   |
| `keypress`   | any button except Shift, Fn, CapsLock is pressed (fires continuously) |
| `click`      | the mouse has been pressed and released                               |
| `mousedown`  | the mouse has been pressed                                            |
| `mouseup`    | the mouse has been released                                           |
| `mouseenter` | the mouse has entered the element                                     |
| `mouseleave` | the mouse has exited the element                                      |
| `mousemove`  | the mouse has moved on the element                                    |

### `load` and `unload`

```javascript
window.onload = function () {
  alert("loading before everything else");
};
```

The `beforeunload` event is called immediately before an element is unloaded. This can be used on the window to ask whether the use wants to leave a page without saving their data.

```javascript
window.onbeforeunload = function () {
  return "Are you sure you want to leave?";
};
```

### `input` and `change`

The `input` and `change` events can be used with `input` elements to detect when the user changes a value. The `input` event is triggered whenever a letter is entered. The `change` event is triggered when the element loses focus and the value has been changed.

```html
<input id="user_input" type="text" />
<script>
  const user_input = document.getElementById("user_input");

  user_input.addEventListener("input", function () {
    console.log("user entered some text: " + user_input.value);
  });
  user_input.addEventListener("change", function () {
    console.log("user entered some text: " + user_input.value);
  });
</script>
```

### Keyboard Events

You can view a list of keycodes on [css-tricks.com](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/javascript/javascript-keycodes/).

| Event      | Triggered when...                                                     |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `keydown`  | any key is pressed                                                    |
| `keyup`    | any key is released                                                   |
| `keypress` | any button except Shift, Fn, CapsLock is pressed (fires continuously) |

```html
<script>
  document.body.onkeydown = function (evt) {
    alert(evt.keyCode);
  };
</script>
```

### Mouse Events

| Event        | Triggered when...                       |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `click`      | the mouse has been pressed and released |
| `mousedown`  | the mouse has been pressed              |
| `mouseup`    | the mouse has been released             |
| `mouseenter` | the mouse has entered the element       |
| `mouseleave` | the mouse has exited the element        |
| `mousemove`  | the mouse has moved on the element      |

```html
<body>
  <div id="container"></div>
  <style>
    #container {
      width: 200px;
      height: 200px;
      background: red;
    }
  </style>
  <script>
    const container = document.querySelector("#container");
    container.addEventListener("mouseenter", function (event) {
      if (event.target.style.backgroundColor == "blue") {
        event.target.style.backgroundColor = "red";
      } else {
        event.target.style.backgroundColor = "blue";
      }
    });
  </script>
</body>
```

### Determining the Mouse's Position

The event parameter that's passed to the function contains the coordinates of the mouse, and which button is pressed.

```html
 <style>
       body{
           height: 100vh;
           width: 100vw;
       }
</style>
<script>
const body = document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]
function move(event){
  let x = event.clientX;
  let y = event.clientY;
  console.log(x,y)
}
body.addEventListener('mousemove', move)

</script>
```
